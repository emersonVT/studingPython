RPG Character Builder - Python Solution
Project Overview
    This Python project implements a character creation system for a Role-Playing Game (RPG).
    The application validates character attributes and formats the output according to specific requirements.

Problem Statement
    Create a function create_character that:
    - Validates character name and attributes
    - Returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
    - Formats valid character data into a visual representation

Validation Rules
    Name Validation
        - Type Check: Must be a string
        - Error: "The character name should be a string"

        - Non-empty: Must not be empty
        - Error: "The character should have a name"

        - Length Limit: Maximum 10 characters
        - Error: "The character name is too long"

        - No Spaces: Must not contain spaces
        - Error: "The character name should not contain spaces"

    Stats Validation
        Integer Check: All stats must be integers
            - Error: "All stats should be integers"
            
            - Minimum Value: All stats must be ≥ 1
            - Error: "All stats should be no less than 1"

            - Maximum Value: All stats must be ≤ 4
            - Error: "All stats should be no more than 4"

            - Total Points: Sum of all stats must equal 7
            - Error: "The character should start with 7 points"

Success Output Format
    - When all validations pass, return a four-line string:
    - Character name
    - Strength stat visualization
    - Intelligence stat visualization
    - Charisma stat visualization
